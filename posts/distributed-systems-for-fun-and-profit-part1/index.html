&ldquo;Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit&rdquo; is a booklet introducing distributed systems freely published online by mixu in 2013.
Two outcomes of distribution:

Information travels at the speed of light
Independent nodes fail independently

Distributed systems deal with the problems of distance and multiple nodes.
1. Distributed Systems at a High Level
Basic tasks of a computer:

Storage
Computation

Distributed programming is using multiple machines to solve the same problem as on a single machine, usually because the problem has outgrown the capacity of a single machine."><meta name=author content="zhoukuncheng"><link rel=canonical href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/posts/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit-part1/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.343cc480b9ffc8f04ccbe5e968ad674880cab773ec19905e93033065c1e7a804.css integrity="sha256-NDzEgLn/yPBMy+XpaK1nSIDKt3PsGZBekwMwZcHnqAQ=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/zh/posts/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit-part1/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/posts/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit-part1/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-GH88YSLNJN"></script><script>var doNotTrack=!1,dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes";if(!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-GH88YSLNJN")}</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/posts/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit-part1/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="zhoukuncheng's Personal Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Notes on 'Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit' (Part 1)"><meta property="og:description" content="0.

Distributed Systems at a High Level Basic tasks of a computer:\nStorage Computation Distributed programming is using multiple machines to solve the same problem as on a single machine, usually because the problem has outgrown the capacity of a single machine.\nAt a small scale, upgrading hardware on a single node can solve the problem, but as the scale increases, when single-node upgrades cannot solve the problem or become too expensive, distributed systems are needed. Currently, the most cost-effective approach uses mid-range commodity hardware, lowering costs through fault-tolerant software.\nAdding new machines does not linearly increase performance and capacity as in an ideal scenario.\nThis article focuses on distributed programming in data centers.\nImplementation Goals: Scalability and Other Benefits Scalability Scalability: The ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.\nSize scalability Geographic scalability Administrative scalability Performance and Latency Performance: The amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system compared to the time and resources used.\nLatency: Essentially the time it takes for new data to appear in the system. In distributed systems, this is constrained by the speed of light and disk speeds, etc.\nAvailability (Fault Tolerance) Availability: The proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. Availability = uptime / (uptime + downtime).\nDistributed systems can tolerate partial failures through redundancy.\nFault tolerance: The ability of a system to continue operating in a properly defined manner after the failure of some of its components.\nConstraints Distributed systems are constrained by two physical factors:\nNumber of nodes (increases with required storage and computing power) Distance between nodes (information travels at most at the speed of light) Performance and availability are defined externally, usually expressed as SLAs (Service Level Agreements).\nAbstractions and Models Abstractions make things manageable; models precisely describe the key properties of distributed systems.\nFor example:\nSystem model (Asynchronous/Synchronous) Failure model (Crash failures, Partitions, Byzantine) Consistency model (Strong consistency, Eventual consistency) Design Techniques: Partitioning and Replication Partitioning Dividing a large dataset into smaller independent sets.\nPartitioning improves performance by limiting the amount of data to be examined and locating related data in the same partition. Partitioning improves availability by allowing partitions to fail independently. Replication Copying the same data on multiple machines is the primary way to combat latency.\nImproves performance by adding computing power and bandwidth on new data copies. Improves availability by creating additional copies of data. Replication needs to follow a consistency model.\n","wordCount":"465","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-09-11T01:51:32+08:00","dateModified":"2020-09-11T01:51:32+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"zhoukuncheng"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/posts/distributed-systems-for-fun-and-profit-part1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zhoukuncheng's Personal Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zhoukuncheng.github.io/ accesskey=h title="zhoukuncheng's Personal Blog (Alt + H)">zhoukuncheng's Personal Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
